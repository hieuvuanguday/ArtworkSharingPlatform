/**
 * The {@code ArtworkDTO} class represents a Data Transfer Object (DTO) for
 * artwork information within the OnlyArts application. It encapsulates details
 * such as artwork ID, owner ID, category ID, privacy level, name, description,
 * artwork image, price, quantity, release date, and status. Instances of this
 * class are used to transfer artwork data between different layers of the
 * application, providing a standardized format for artwork-related information.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * ArtworkDTO artwork = new ArtworkDTO();
 * artwork.setArtworkId("123");
 * artwork.setOwnerId("456");
 * artwork.setCateId("789");
 * artwork.setPrivacy(1);
 * artwork.setName("Artwork Name");
 * artwork.setDescription("Artwork Description");
 * artwork.setArtworkImage("/path/to/image.jpg");
 * artwork.setPrice(99.99f);
 * artwork.setQuantity(10L);
 * artwork.setReleasedDate(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
 * artwork.setStatus("Active");
 * }</pre>
